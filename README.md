This is the first repository that I've made (that wasn't imported because of a class assignment). I've made a script command which creates a directory, opens Google Chrome, logs into Github, creates a github repository, adds a couple files, README.md and a python file.

The command works as follows:

    $ createpy <dir_name> <file_name>
    
dir_name will become the name both the directory that's created on my computer as well as the name of the github repository.
    
file_name is the name of the python file that's created. I currently have it set up so that the user can pick the name of the file, but I'm thinking about giving it a default name, such as source.py or using dir_name.

The idea for this project came from Kalle Hallden's youtube video "One Day Builds: Automating My Projects With Python" (@Kalle Hallden on youtube)
